bellman ford algorithm(no negative cycle)


1) take a weighted graph witch has no negative cycle but negative edge and also take a source node

2) output distance of all node from the source node

3) creat a distance array and make all index = infinity  initially

4) make the source node distance = 0

5) call the bellman function with souce node



.............NOW THE BELLMAN-FORD FUNCTION..............


1) A FOR LOOP WILL CONTINUE n-1 time{

-----NOW WE HAVE TO TRAVERS ALL THE EDGES

     -------NOW THE RELAX PART WILL CONTINEU

}
